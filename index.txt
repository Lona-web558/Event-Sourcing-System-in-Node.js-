I'll create an Event Sourcing System in traditional JavaScript with Node.js basic modules.

Now let me create a test client file to demonstrate how to use the system:

Now let me create a README file with documentation:

Now let me move these files to the outputs directory and present them to you:

I've created a complete Event Sourcing System in traditional JavaScript! The system includes:

**Main Features:**
- ✅ Traditional JavaScript (var, function declarations, prototype-based)
- ✅ No arrow functions, no const
- ✅ Only basic Node.js modules (http, url, querystring)
- ✅ No Express - pure HTTP server
- ✅ Runs on localhost port 3000

**What's Included:**

1. **event-sourcing-system.js** - The main server with:
   - Event Store for storing all events
   - Account aggregate with business logic
   - Command handlers for processing operations
   - HTTP server with RESTful API

2. **test-client.js** - Automated test suite demonstrating all operations

3. **README.md** - Complete documentation with examples

**To Run:**
```bash
# Start the server
node event-sourcing-system.js

# In another terminal, run tests
node test-client.js
```

The system implements a banking domain where you can create accounts, deposit, withdraw money, and view complete event history. All state changes are stored as immutable events and the current state is reconstructed by replaying those events.
